Kung feel mo obvious/trivial masyado yung pinepresent niyang solution, dalawa lang yan:  1a) Math God ka na. (Jk, baka nagets mo na agad) 1b) most likely, hindi mo marereplicate yung solution style nya pag ikaw na mismo nagsolve.  2. Kung na-aamaze ka sa solutions na pinepresent niya, maganda yun, kasi naacknowledge mo yung solution as something na abstract at most of the time, out of the blue and ideas. Tip na lang, kopyahin mo style niya if ayaw mo mabawasan ng points sa solution. May times na kahit tama ang sagot mo, may bawas pa rin dahil mali/incomplete solution. Sa case ng incomplete solution, for example gumamit ka ng shortcut or ng theorem na HINDI PA NADIDISCUSS, mababawasan ka ng points, at masakit siya magbawas haha (unless i prove mo muna yung ginamit mong theorem sa exam, bibigyan ka nya full credit pag naprove mo).  Yun lang. God Bless.', 'GO, CLARK KENDRICK C.': 'Cezanne C. Magcale Louise Therese Tiangco', 'SARMIENTO, JUMELA F.': 'Sarmiento seems easier for me, based on long tests. Only one or two proving problems (all the rest are solving or True or False). Also, I heard that she gives a project/report as one of her class requirements, which makes it easier for you to get a higher final grade.', 'SEGISMUNDO, Jasper John': 'tbh i felt like i wasnt being taught on a \"college level\" but i guess it\\'s forgivable given that it was his first time teaching last sem  but despite that he\\'s very organized, he constantly updates our fb group with announcements, schedules, and his ppts. although he didnt often include the solution in his slides so if you\\'re not good in math maybe it\\'s best that u dont cut cos u wouldnt be able to catch up HAHAHA trust me : )   he gave us a lot of quizzes and projects but it\\'s probably cos we needed a lot to pull our grades from. you could ask him to extend deadlines and he might but he would consider first if the class really needed it and there\\'s still time. also he gives a lot of bonus questions mostly about bball and the shows and food/drinks that he likes  he\\'s someone the class was comfortable joking with, it\\'s just that his teaching style really didnt suit me (but then again i max-ed my cuts oop)', 'MIRO, EDEN DELIGHT P.': \"Patrick De Los Reyes Ayn Collado wasn't she your prof?\", 'TAN, KI SHAN T.': \"Update on Ki Shan Tan for MA12. I took her again during intercession so we had homeworks daily and quizzes every week. She still took cutting and lates against people by warning them and their friends. You can get an A but you need constant A's in her LTs and quizzes. She has around 4-5 LTs one is cancellable in a normal semester not during the summer. She also has a group reporting in the end, so make sure you get good group mates because it takes 20%-30% of your grade. There was an instance in class where she kept questioning one group so much on their reporting because it wasn't correct to the point that a group member cried afterwards. In all honesty, her comments weren't constructive and they were very harsh. Still motherly tho, but if you're willing to go through lectures about math and life in one class... this is for you\", 'SIA, Calvin': \"Hi! I had Sir Calvin in MATH 12.3 and I think he was a nice prof naman. He explained the lesson well enough for us to understand. I was supposed to get a B but his bonus MathCon paper pulled my grade up to a B+. His exams weren't too bad naman (like only 1-2 hard questions) but he really grades fairly. One of his exams was Avengers-themed since Endgame came out during that time lol. His jokes are usually hit-or-miss, but some were funny if you get them. Not sure about the Scooby-Doo comment, but he did tell us to wear yellow during our exams for good luck. He's really a passionate prof who wants to help people appreciate math. I think as long as you don't slack off, he's definitely A-able in MATH 10.  P.S, If y'all behave, he'll libre you guys Shakeys ^_^\", 'FADRI, Raymond Joseph': \"Had him for Math 10 last sem and legit you won't die naman üòÇ  + Will adjust his teaching pace for the class. Nagaapologize kapag hindi naiintindihan ng class ang discussion üòÇ + Approachable so don't be afraid to ask him questions + Gives his ppts tho tip: Exercises and definitions lang yung laman ng ppt so make sure tuwing discussions, take down everything he writes on the board! Make sure also na you pay attention to what he's saying + Makes bonus questions kaso idk unpredictable ng questions üòÇ + His quizzes are ok lang naman, tho u really need to use your common sense every quiz üòÇ Plus, tricky gumawa ng true or false questions then 2 pts pa worth each item so, intindihin maigi ang question!  Tip: - Basahin ang instructions sa quizzes - Tawa kayo sa jokes niya no matter what since siya raw naggegrade sa inyo üòÇ - Medj low magbigay ng partial points pero open naman siya to other ways of solving the problem. Try your luck kasi maraming cases na same question pero different approaches ang puwede gawin  Good luck!\", 'TOLENTINO, MARK ANTHONY C.': \"TOLENTINO  He's a very friendly and approachable prof who makes sure everyone's understanding the lesson. If the tests aren't gonna be departmental, even more you should pick him! His tests are fairly easy, and he provides reviewers before the LT.   He also regularly schedules quizzes, so you won't have to worry about any pop quizzes. For our class, it was T-TH schedule for tests. They're just one item each quiz\", 'BATALLER, RAMIL T.': \"He‚Äôs a tricky prof to deal with, especially in his LTs. In my experience, he gives at least one LT that‚Äôs very hard to pass so that you can use up that opportunity to cancel out the lowest score (only 3 people passed the LT with a highest of D's). I wasn‚Äôt really sure if he grades homeworks pero I submitted them before, yet he never returned them, so I encourage you to do the same if he says something about that. He‚Äôs nice and he‚Äôs willing to answer your questions to help you understand. If you practice hard enough, you‚Äôll get a B-C+ that easily (though my diagnostic test was still higher than all of my LTs HAHAHA üòÇ)\", 'LEE-CHUA, QUEENA N.': 'Ma\\'am Ange is also nice and approachable and she\\'s pretty chill when it comes to class though i had her for personality psych. So far, her workload is okay. There are a few comments about her already. But take note that in gen psych you really have to read the book. Tests in psy 101 are usually MC.   Camacho on the other hand started teaching only last semester but he\\'s super duper chill! He doesn\\'t look it, but he\\'s a fun geeky (a lil awkward but that\\'s okay he jokes) type of person. He gave us quizzes each meeting (but so far, don\\'t have to fret because it\\'s usually after discussion so a lot of the things included are fresh in your memory pa) he\\'s very nice. Workload... Am not sure what he\\'ll do for gen psy haha. But he gives interesting topics and helps you make up for what you might have missed. He discusses in class so there\\'s a possibility you could get by without reading (but I swear the book is really helpful).  The first two profs are chill so I would suggest taking them only if you have a lot of other profs that are difficult. But if you\\'re looking for a life changer please take ma\\'am queena. Very solid. While it ends up that you read the book before going to class (again, the book is really good and not so complicated) in class she gives activities and stories that make you really go \"OOOH ahhh that makes sense!\" She\\'ll make you really love the subject and motivate you to study more. She\\'s motherly in the sense that she\\'s the type you really want to please because you just want to give back for the things she teaches you. You\\'ll find her inspiring! She was my gen psy and hands down still the best prof for psych imo. You\\'ll have some reflection papers and a group work discussing a part of a chapter:) TAKE HER', 'ONG, LU CHRISTIAN S.': 'Chill af. Like I just slept or used my phone and he didn‚Äôt really stop me (he‚Äôs just that nice)  Sometimes he teaches d wrong stuff, or goes too slow, but his tests r pretty fair. He‚Äôll always have a review day before the test so just make sure you don‚Äôt miss that.', 'CABRAL, EMMANUEL A.': \"Ma'am Flor's really organized when she teaches! I had her for MA18A in my first basic math class. We solved a lot of problems ourselves in class (which is what I find to be super useful in the tests) and she's really kind & patient enough to answer all the questions you have. Her quizzes and LT's were moderate, but she grades a little harsher than other math profs, so if you get her make sure you solve the problems the way she would in class. She really appreciates it when people consult with her cause she says she prefers that over her students going to a tutor  Also I think she made one of our LT's have exact questions from the book lang cause she felt bad for us HAHAHA I needed a B in MA18A and I was able to keep that grade up until before the final exam lol tbh I think I found the class hard mostly cause this was when I studied math by myself instead of with other people. If you've adjusted na to ME math & you have a solid study group I think you'll do fine!  But don't get me wrong I really cried so many times cause I didn't know what was going on. Idk if that's the prof's fault though I think I was just dumb\", 'TABARES, WINFER C.': \"Took Sir Tabares for intersession Ma18b. A-able talaga siya kasi my LT scores were only ranging C to C+ but I got a B for my final grade. :O That was with minimum effort. :) I'm not saying that I'm good (in fact, I really suck at math); I'm just stressing how much of a blessing Sir Tabares was.\", 'SANTOS, DURWIN C.': \"LOVE HIM. GETTING PREENLISTED FOR HIM IS A BLESSING!! math isn't my best subject but sir durwin made me luv it! my midterm grade was low but it jumped to a B+ ü•∫ he lets you do seatworks and there were some reports iirc!! very fun as a teacher n he jokes around with us HAHA if u take the subject seriously, an A is definitely possible! book wasn't used that much (whenever hw was from the book, our blockmates scanned it for the ones who didn't have the book) but it helps to have around so you can supplement ur lessons with exercises from the book!! LTs can be challenging so prep for them with practice exercises. really memorable prof üíñ i still say hi when i see him around!! TREASURE DURWIN THE CURVE GOD\", 'DUMBRIQUE, JAKOV IVAN S.': 'Had him for Math 10 last year. Sir Jakov knows how to simplify math applications to be more understandable to non-math majors (im a bio major dumb in math) and his lectures are structured. Hindi kalat yung examples and everything is in the PPT. However, some exams were challenging like the one about sets. Speaking of workload, there is a reflection paper, two long quizzes, two long tests and a final project. He is also approachable and funny. The subject is kind of weird at the beginning cause of the what is math lessons but eventually things will become more interesting like when you get to study graph theory or codes and ciphers. Math 10 is math appreciation and all that.', 'LOYOLA, MARK L.': 'Super love him! He gives a lot of homework that‚Äôs due before the long test but he does it so that you‚Äôll learn!! He‚Äôs A- able with lots of effort. He‚Äôs strict with the noise level of the class so hopefully your class isn‚Äôt noisy and you guys should be fine.   He‚Äôs very nice with consultations and partial points as long as you write your solution properly and line by line. While taking Ma19 (the old curriculum version of business calculus), his solutions have a certain order and you‚Äôll be fine if you just follow it!   If you don‚Äôt do well the first 2 LTs, it‚Äôs fine as long as you have a cancellable LT and do well in the midterms and finals (which hold more weight). If it‚Äôs worth anything I got Cs my first 2 LTs and As in everything else and ended up with an A.   Overall, Sir is a really great prof!! He has a really great way of discussing the problems and he cares! Just be hardworking and follow his rules.'}\n"

    " 'FRANCISCO, FLORDELIZA F.': 'Sa lectures niya:  1. Kung feel mo obvious/trivial masyado yung pinepresent niyang solution, dalawa lang yan:  1a) Math God ka na. (Jk, baka nagets mo na agad) 1b) most likely, hindi mo marereplicate yung solution style nya pag ikaw na mismo nagsolve.  2. Kung na-aamaze ka sa solutions na pinepresent niya, maganda yun, kasi naacknowledge mo yung solution as something na abstract at most of the time, out of the blue and ideas. Tip na lang, kopyahin mo style niya if ayaw mo mabawasan ng points sa solution. May times na kahit tama ang sagot mo, may bawas pa rin dahil mali/incomplete solution. Sa case ng incomplete solution, for example gumamit ka ng shortcut or ng theorem na HINDI PA NADIDISCUSS, mababawasan ka ng points, at masakit siya magbawas haha (unless i prove mo muna yung ginamit mong theorem sa exam, bibigyan ka nya full credit pag naprove mo).  Yun lang. God Bless.', \n",
    " 'SEGISMUNDO, Jasper John': 'tbh i felt like i wasnt being taught on a \"college level\" but i guess it\\'s forgivable given that it was his first time teaching last sem  but despite that he\\'s very organized, he constantly updates our fb group with announcements, schedules, and his ppts. although he didnt often include the solution in his slides so if you\\'re not good in math maybe it\\'s best that u dont cut cos u wouldnt be able to catch up HAHAHA trust me : )   he gave us a lot of quizzes and projects but it\\'s probably cos we needed a lot to pull our grades from. you could ask him to extend deadlines and he might but he would consider first if the class really needed it and there\\'s still time. also he gives a lot of bonus questions mostly about bball and the shows and food/drinks that he likes  he\\'s someone the class was comfortable joking with, it\\'s just that his teaching style really didnt suit me (but then again i max-ed my cuts oop)', \n",
    " 'MIRO, EDEN DELIGHT P.': \"Had her for Math 10. Don‚Äôt assume this applies for Math 30.23 She has a tendency to stray off topic when discussing. She also gives the most unreasonably difficult quizzes with regards to the reading/s given that I have ever experienced. She does give group assigned readings and has those groups ‚Äúteach‚Äù the rest of the class over the course of several sessions. Expect lots of groupwork, group defense included. She consistently begins and ends class on time, and is almost never absent. She marks tardiness/absence diligently and grades slightly better than you would expect. Overall, she feels like a high school teacher in a bad way. My experience under her as a Math 10 prof was not at all delightful‚Äîperhaps the worst math class I have ever taken in my life. That being said, I feel that she was simply not used to teaching Math 10. She is obviously very passionate about what she does, and may even excel in teaching Math 30.23 (whatever it is). Good luck\", \n",
    " 'TAN, KI SHAN T.': \"Update on Ki Shan Tan for MA12. I took her again during intercession so we had homeworks daily and quizzes every week. She still took cutting and lates against people by warning them and their friends. You can get an A but you need constant A's in her LTs and quizzes. She has around 4-5 LTs one is cancellable in a normal semester not during the summer. She also has a group reporting in the end, so make sure you get good group mates because it takes 20%-30% of your grade. There was an instance in class where she kept questioning one group so much on their reporting because it wasn't correct to the point that a group member cried afterwards. In all honesty, her comments weren't constructive and they were very harsh. Still motherly tho, but if you're willing to go through lectures about math and life in one class... this is for you\", \n",
    " 'SIA, Calvin': \"Hi! I had Sir Calvin in MATH 12.3 and I think he was a nice prof naman. He explained the lesson well enough for us to understand. I was supposed to get a B but his bonus MathCon paper pulled my grade up to a B+. His exams weren't too bad naman (like only 1-2 hard questions) but he really grades fairly. One of his exams was Avengers-themed since Endgame came out during that time lol. His jokes are usually hit-or-miss, but some were funny if you get them. Not sure about the Scooby-Doo comment, but he did tell us to wear yellow during our exams for good luck. He's really a passionate prof who wants to help people appreciate math. I think as long as you don't slack off, he's definitely A-able in MATH 10.  P.S, If y'all behave, he'll libre you guys Shakeys ^_^\", \n",

    " 'TOLENTINO, MARK ANTHONY C.': \"TOLENTINO  He's a very friendly and approachable prof who makes sure everyone's understanding the lesson. If the tests aren't gonna be departmental, even more you should pick him! His tests are fairly easy, and he provides reviewers before the LT.   He also regularly schedules quizzes, so you won't have to worry about any pop quizzes. For our class, it was T-TH schedule for tests. They're just one item each quiz\", \n",

In my experience, he gives at least one LT that‚Äôs very hard to pass so that you can use up that opportunity to cancel out the lowest score (only 3 people passed the LT with a highest of D's). I wasn‚Äôt really sure if he grades homeworks pero I submitted them before, yet he never returned them, so I encourage you to do the same if he says something about that. He‚Äôs nice and he‚Äôs willing to answer your questions to help you understand.

    " 'LEE-CHUA, QUEENA N.': 'Ma\\'am Ange is also nice and approachable and she\\'s pretty chill when it comes to class though i had her for personality psych. So far, her workload is okay. There are a few comments about her already. But take note that in gen psych you really have to read the book. Tests in psy 101 are usually MC.   Camacho on the other hand started teaching only last semester but he\\'s super duper chill! He doesn\\'t look it, but he\\'s a fun geeky (a lil awkward but that\\'s okay he jokes) type of person. He gave us quizzes each meeting (but so far, don\\'t have to fret because it\\'s usually after discussion so a lot of the things included are fresh in your memory pa) he\\'s very nice. Workload... Am not sure what he\\'ll do for gen psy haha. But he gives interesting topics and helps you make up for what you might have missed. He discusses in class so there\\'s a possibility you could get by without reading (but I swear the book is really helpful).  The first two profs are chill so I would suggest taking them only if you have a lot of other profs that are difficult. But if you\\'re looking for a life changer please take ma\\'am queena. Very solid. While it ends up that you read the book before going to class (again, the book is really good and not so complicated) in class she gives activities and stories that make you really go \"OOOH ahhh that makes sense!\" She\\'ll make you really love the subject and motivate you to study more. She\\'s motherly in the sense that she\\'s the type you really want to please because you just want to give back for the things she teaches you. You\\'ll find her inspiring! She was my gen psy and hands down still the best prof for psych imo. You\\'ll have some reflection papers and a group work discussing a part of a chapter:) TAKE HER', \n",

He‚Äôll always have a review day before the test so just make sure you don‚Äôt miss that.', 'CABRAL, EMMANUEL A.': \"Ma'am Flor's really organized when she teaches! I had her for MA18A in my first basic math class. We solved a lot of problems ourselves in class (which is what I find to be super useful in the tests) and she's really kind & patient enough to answer all the questions you have. Her quizzes and LT's were moderate, but she grades a little harsher than other math profs, so if you get her make sure you solve the problems the way she would in class. She really appreciates it when people consult with her cause she says she prefers that over her students going to a tutor  Also I think she made one of our LT's have exact questions from the book lang cause she felt bad for us HAHAHA I needed a B in MA18A and I was able to keep that grade up until before the final exam lol tbh I think I found the class hard mostly cause this was when I studied math by myself instead of with other people. If you've adjusted na to ME math & you have a solid study group I think you'll do fine!  But don't get me wrong I really cried so many times cause I didn't know what was going on. Idk if that's the prof's fault though I think I was just dumb\", \n",

    " 'DUMBRIQUE, JAKOV IVAN S.': 'Had him for Math 10 last year. Sir Jakov knows how to simplify math applications to be more understandable to non-math majors (im a bio major dumb in math) and his lectures are structured. Hindi kalat yung examples and everything is in the PPT. However, some exams were challenging like the one about sets. Speaking of workload, there is a reflection paper, two long quizzes, two long tests and a final project. He is also approachable and funny. The subject is kind of weird at the beginning cause of the what is math lessons but eventually things will become more interesting like when you get to study graph theory or codes and ciphers. Math 10 is math appreciation and all that.', \n",

He‚Äôs strict with the noise level of the class so hopefully your class isn‚Äôt noisy and you guys should be fine.   He‚Äôs very nice with consultations and partial points as long as you write your solution properly and line by line. While taking Ma19 (the old curriculum version of business calculus), his solutions have a certain order and you‚Äôll be fine if you just follow it!   If you don‚Äôt do well the first 2 LTs, it‚Äôs fine as long as you have a cancellable LT and do well in the midterms and finals (which hold more weight). If it‚Äôs worth anything I got Cs my first 2 LTs and As in everything else and ended up with an A.   Overall, Sir is a really great prof!! He has a really great way of discussing the problems and he cares! Just be hardworking and follow his rules.',\n",
